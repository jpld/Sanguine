=============
quartz composer plug-in which executes MacRuby with an arbitrary number of input and output parameters. the plug-in needs to run in a garbage collected host, as MacRuby runs in the ObjC Runtime and requires GC to manage memory. the quartz composer editor **does not** currently support GC.
